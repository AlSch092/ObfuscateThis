# ObfuscateThis
Templated Obfuscation example in C++ for protecting/hiding values in memory  

Currently two different methods are displayed in Obfuscate.cpp: regular arithmetic and key-based. Arithmetic obfuscation uses a simple XOR operation along with an addition/subtraction. Key-based uses a similar approach, but the value used to add and subtract after XORing is generated by a deterministic value from a given key integer. Using the key-based approach, values can only be properly deobfuscated if the correct key is given. More methods will be added as they are thought of. 

The original value is only seen in memory for a few assembler instructions, and we can set our routines as inline to make function hooking and analysis more difficult.  

If you have any suggestions or methods you'd like to add, please feel free with a fork+PR or issue!
